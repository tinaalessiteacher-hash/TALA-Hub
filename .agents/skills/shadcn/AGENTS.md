## Abstract

Comprehensive best practices guide for shadcn/ui applications, designed for AI agents and LLMs. Contains 42 rules across 8 categories, prioritized by impact from critical (component architecture, accessibility preservation) to incremental (state management). Each rule includes detailed explanations, real-world examples comparing incorrect vs. correct implementations, and specific impact metrics to guide automated refactoring and code generation.

## Table of Contents

1. Component Architecture — **CRITICAL**
   - 1.1 [Extend Variants with Class Variance Authority](references/arch-extend-variants-with-cva.md) — CRITICAL (maintains type safety and design consistency)
   - 1.2 [Forward Refs for Composable Components](references/arch-forward-refs-for-composable-components.md) — CRITICAL (enables integration with form libraries and focus management)
   - 1.3 [Isolate Component Variants from Base Styles](references/arch-isolate-component-variants.md) — CRITICAL (prevents style bleeding and maintains component reusability)
   - 1.4 [Preserve Radix Primitive Structure](references/arch-preserve-radix-primitive-structure.md) — CRITICAL (maintains keyboard navigation and focus management)
   - 1.5 [Use the Generated Primitive's Composition API](references/arch-use-asChild-for-custom-triggers.md) — CRITICAL (preserves accessibility and event handling)
   - 1.6 [Use cn() for Safe Class Merging](references/arch-use-cn-for-class-merging.md) — CRITICAL (prevents Tailwind class conflicts)
   - 1.7 [Use the Current CLI for Component Lifecycle](references/arch-current-cli-registry.md) — MEDIUM-HIGH (dry-run installs, namespaced registries, and agent-friendly inspection)
   - 1.8 [Import Primitives from the Unified radix-ui Package](references/arch-unified-radix-package.md) — LOW-MEDIUM (one import source instead of dozens of @radix-ui packages)
2. Accessibility Preservation — **CRITICAL**

   - 2.4 [Preserve Keyboard Navigation Patterns](references/ally-preserve-keyboard-navigation.md) — CRITICAL (enables non-mouse users to navigate components)
   - 2.5 [Provide Screen Reader Labels for Icon Buttons](references/ally-provide-sr-only-labels.md) — CRITICAL (enables navigation for visually impaired users)
3. Styling & Theming — **HIGH**
   - 3.1 [Apply Mobile-First Responsive Design](references/style-responsive-design-patterns.md) — HIGH (prevents mobile usability failures on mobile traffic)

4. Form Patterns — **HIGH**
   - 4.1 [Handle Async Validation with Debouncing](references/form-handle-async-validation.md) — HIGH (prevents excessive API calls during validation)
   - 4.2 [Reset Form State Correctly After Submission](references/form-reset-form-state-correctly.md) — HIGH (prevents stale data and submission errors)
   - 4.3 [Show Validation Errors at Appropriate Times](references/form-show-validation-errors-correctly.md) — HIGH (improves user experience and reduces frustration)
   - 4.4 [Use React Hook Form with shadcn/ui Forms](references/form-use-react-hook-form-integration.md) — HIGH (eliminates re-renders and provides validation)
   - 4.5 [Use Zod for Schema Validation](references/form-use-zod-for-schema-validation.md) — HIGH (eliminates runtime type errors with full TS inference)

   - 6.2 [Compose with Compound Component Patterns](references/comp-compose-with-compound-components.md) — MEDIUM (reduces prop count vs monolithic components)
   - 6.3 [Create Reusable Form Field Components](references/comp-create-reusable-form-fields.md) — MEDIUM (reduces boilerplate and ensures consistency)
   - 6.4 [Nest Dialogs with Proper Focus Management](references/comp-nest-dialogs-correctly.md) — MEDIUM (maintains focus trap hierarchy in nested modals)
